# React with FastAPI

React with FastAPI testing ground for ML/DL pre-trained models.

## Setup

Clone the [music classification repository](https://github.com/nugglet/Music-Genre-Classification) I did in the previous trimester into the model folder and rename the folder as `music_genre_classification`.

1. Run `./api/main.py` to start the FastAPI Uvicorn server.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the React server.

Input the relative path to the music file you have.
